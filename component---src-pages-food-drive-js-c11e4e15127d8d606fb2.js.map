The community consists of around 400 migrated families living in extremely impro-\nvised condi/on. The male members of the families work either as daily labourers or garbage pickers.\n\nThe women mostly work as household help in nearby areas or join men in garbage picking. The chil-\ndren mostly stay at home, looking aJer their siblings.

The area lacks any form of proper, con-\ncrete paths. The roads are extremely bumpy and are a mix of scaDered gravels, mud puddles and soil.\n\nThe houses are temporary tent like seDlements, put together with bricks, mud, plas/c sheets and\nbamboo.\nThe members were offered to sit in an office in the same lane. It apparently belonged to our resource\nperson who lives there. The staffs in the office were warm and welcoming. They humbly offered tea\nand refreshments and were keen to understand and appreciate the Associa/on’s mission and help\nthem with any informa/on they wanted about the dwellers. They also shared the challenges they face\nwhile working for the concerned community, which one might encounter as well, and mentored ways\nto tackle them\nThe drive was delayed for a few hours due to transport vehicle being stuck in the traffic. Meanwhile,\nthe team members were warmly offered lunch by the resource person. Since the\nfood coupons were already distributed the day before, thus everything was set to run systematically.\nThe plan of action was to collect their coupons and copies of their identity card on one counter and\ndistribute ration kits on the other.\nOnce the transport arrived, the members moved to an empty plot of land where the distribution was\nscheduled. A few plastic chairs and 2 wooden beds constituted the make-shiJ counters. The crowd of\nration collectors constituted mostly of women. The reason being men mostly went out during day to\n\nfind daily wage works. Despite it being uDerly humid day, the turnout was huge and the crowd was co-\noperative. The collectors included many people who were either too old or handicapped. The team\n\nmembers readily helped such people to carry their kits to their homes. The local community was ex-\ntremely helpful and time and again offered to fill water boDles for the members while they worked in\n\nthe sun. It took about 45 minutes to an hour to distribute 50 ration kits, thanks to the systematic setup.\nAJer half of the kits were distributed, there was another interruption of about 45 minutes because of a\nsimilar problem with the transport, that was meant to carry the other half of the kits. During this break\nmany members from the community came requesting for a spare kit, either because they haven’t been\nalloDed coupons in the current phase, or for an extended family that was in uDer need. Due to 1:1 ratio\nbetween the alloDed coupons to ration kits, such demands could not be entertained.\nOnce the transport arrived, it took another 45 minutes to distribute the rest of the kits.</p>\n\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={fooddrive3} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Analysis</h2>\n            <p>The distribution of ration-kits was planned to help the community members with the most basic re-\nquirement- food. It was taken under consideration that a long-term help could be provided to them.\n\nThus raton-kits, as opposed to prepared meals, were distributed.\nThis distribution ensured that a hundred, middle-sized families would be fed for about a month. The\n\npulses, rice, flour, sugar and oil constitute the staple diet for Indian households. By selecting the bene-\nTYPE TO ENTER A CAPTION.\n\nficiaries for the first phase of distribution on the basis of urgency of need, as opposed to random selection, helped the Association to make sure the emergencies are tackled first.</p>\n\n<h2>Reflections:</h2>\n            <p>It was found, during the activity that the reasons that contributed to the community’s impoverished\ncondi/on was much larger than unemployment and economic weakness.\nThe first apparent problem was linguistic. Since the community consisted mostly of immigrants, they\nlacked fluency in the regional language. This made it difficult for them to work in the local sector,\n\nwhere they belonged. Along with this, rampant illiteracy made them ignorant to reach out to the au-\nthori/es for help, opening doors to bigger problems. For example, many members\n\nof the community owned an AADHAR card, thanks to the efforts of some local social work groups,\nhowever the cards had many technical errors from spellings to address. Understandably they never got\nit corrected, because they could neither read, nor understand the possible problems they might face in\nfuture due to it.\nThe second problem was poor living conditions that contributed to diseases. Since the community is\ncoopera/ve, larger drives like medical awareness and health-camps can be organised by community\npar/cipa/on.\nRampant unemployment and dire shortage of skill-development and vocational training programmes in\nthe area contribute to its economic backwardness.</p>\n\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={fooddrive4} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Generic\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/fooddrive2-016e657b95df2377f157338570d6bfff.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/fooddrive3-ae89655ca6fa5a0b4983d8f10c2bae43.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/fooddrive4-c5280d419b34a6e7c1958a1554b06c39.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/fooddrive1-78a36846a9228dcfd822e6c2cd5bab6c.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
