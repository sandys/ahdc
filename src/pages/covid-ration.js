who had just started rebuilding their lives. They are now fighting with this medical lock-
down without food and basic essentials. There are also very many daily wagers and

labourers who are suddenly jobless and hence penny less. And they cannot fight hunger &
disease together. So AHDC is trying to reach out to as many daily wagers, labourers and
survivors in North East Delhi to help them buy ration & essentials. Food & medicines is
priority at this time and we are doing this in multiple ways with all legal permissions and
extreme precautions. We extend help in few ways:
<ul>
    <li> Pay for peopleâ€™s ration at the local grocery & kirana shops via PayTM/ Phone Pe</li>
    <li> Distribute ration to localities</li>
    <li> Distribute ready-to-eat meals in localities & colonies</li>
    <li> Respond to SOS calls of ration requirements in North East Delhi</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Areas covered: Mustafabad(Old & New), Shiv Vihar, Khajoori Khas, Nehru Vihar, Chand-
bagh, Noor-e-Ilahi, Bhajanpura, Moonga Nagar, Babu Nagar, Subhash Mohalla, Kar-
dampuri.
</p>
<p>
AHDC has served over 10,000 people in various areas of North East Delhi with food & ra-
tion distribution.
