            <h2>March 2020</h2>
            
            <p>When the North East Delhi Pogrom 2020 broke out AHDC started immediate-
ly preparing for relief work. As soon as the violence subsided our teams got

on the ground to assess the damage and figure out relief initiatives. For 15
days AHDC distributed aid and relief material to the victims of the North East
Delhi Pogrom 2020. We were able to reach out to more than 350 people and
give them clothes, blankets, ration and utilities. But very soon we realised that
relief and aid was a short term support. We realised it was important to help
the victims of the North East Delhi pogrom 2020 get back on their feet. They

had families to support and the survivors understood that they can’t be de-
pendent on relief material. It was also a big boost to their confidence when

they are able to restart their lives. They wanted to go back to a life of dignity
and self sufficiency. So AHDC launched the Survivor Rehabilitation Initiative

with an aim to get people back on their feet. We went about this very system-
atically.:
<ul>
    <li> Started with 15 people we identified from the data we had collected during
relief distribution.</li>
    <li> We met these 15 individuals and had detailed discussion with them in our
office in Mustafabad to assess what they needed to restart their work and
how much money would be allocated to each.</li>
    <li> We laid out some ground rules of operation. We would not hand out any
cash to survivors. Our volunteers would accompany the individual and
buy all they require. We would provide all receipts and pictues of goods
purchased for each survivor.</li>
    <li> Post planning for 15 people we started our donations drive activated on
social media and word of mouth.</li>
      <li>Once we had met the targeted amount we called each of the survivors &
bought the goods required by them.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We conducted 3 successful waves of survivor rehabilitation in this manner
when this work had to abruptly stop due to the COVID 19 health crisis. But
we remain committed to this cause. As soon as the lockdown lifts and we are

allowed to resume “regular” work, AHDC will spring back in action to help re-
habilitate more survivors. Here are some successful cases of rehabilitation.

<h2>Ali Ahmed</h2>
            <p>Ali Ahmed was a 60 year old resident of Shiv Vihar. He has a family of 10 and
used to run a small bookshop selling religious books in Shiv Vihar itself near
Medina Masjid. On 25th February things got very dangerous in the area and
he was forced to abandon his shop and flee to the Masjid when angry mobs
surrounded his shop. His shop was looted and his stock destroyed. There
was a lot of damage to the structure also. But we’ve been able to help Ali
Ahmed get back to his livelihood. He needed INR 15,000 to buy a fresh stock
of books he can keep at his shop to re-open it. Our volunteer went with his son(in picture) and bought stock(books) for that much money and now Ali and
his sons are setting up the bookstore again.</p>

    <h2>Israr Ahmed</h2>
            <p>Israr Ahmed, 45, worked as a contractual carpenter and lived in Shiv Vihar
phase 10. He was forced to flee his home with family when violence broke
out in the area on the 25th of February. When he went back to take stock of

damage around 29th Feb he found his whole house was ransacked and loot-
ed. The mobs had destroyed everything including his whole kit of tools. Un-
able to get back to work without it, Israr ji was very disturbed because he is

the sole breadwinner of his family. But now, Israr Ahmed is the owner of a
brand new set of tools which means he can get back to seeking work.</p>

<h2>Riyaz Ud Din</h2>
        <p>Riyaz ud din, a resident of Shiv Vihar phase 7, used to sells eggs on a thela.
He not only lost his home when mobs attacked and looted their at large in
their area, his thela was also snatched and set on fire by the perpetrators.
Riyaz ud din ji has a large family to support and was completely broken in
spirit when we met him. He was a daily wager with no savings and at the age of 67 he didn’t know what other work he could pick up. We were able to give
Riyaz ud din ji a new thela & the first starter stock of eggs to sell. He went
back to work the very day he got the goods!</p>

<h2>Ibrahim</h2>
        <p>Ibrahim is an enterprising young man who ran a small photostat & money
transfer shop in Shiv Vihar. He had flee his shop and take refuge at Medina

Masjid with his family when the mobs attacked. His small shop was complete-
ly destroyed and he himself narrowly escaped when some rioters threw acid

at him. He bears some burn wounds on his leg and feet when droplets landed
on him. He really did escape by the skin of his teeth. Unfortunately he

couldn’t save his shop. But this young man wasted no time in collecting him-
self and started figuring how to get back to his work with some help. When he

came to us he had already figured help with his photostat machine but
couldn’t complete the amount for a laptop he needed. So we pitched in and
helped him buy a laptop. Ibrahim will start his work again.</p>

<h2>Dilshad Khan</h2>
        <p>Dilshad Khan had been running an electrical supplies shop in Shiv Vihar

phase 7 for 19 years. Never had he seen such a carnage. When things esca-
lated in his neighbourhood, he fled his home & shop with his family leaving

everything behind on 25th night. He was only allowed to visit back on 4th
March. And everything he had had been looted. His shop and home both
were ransacked, his stuff thrown out and destroyed, stolen or burnt. Taking
refuge with a relative in Alvi Nagar, for the time being, this father of 3 was

desperate to restart his work. We were able to raise funds for him to buy elec-
trical goods to start his shop again.</p>

<h2>Sayed Ahmed</h2>
        <p>We were able to raise INR 35,000 for Sayed Ahmed ji’s sewing machine re-
pair shop. He is a resident of Shiv Vihar and during the recent violence that

broke out he lost his shop, tools and all supplies. Mobs threw out his goods
and set fire to everything. But now with the help of new equipment he will be
able to start again. He has a 14 year old son and wife to look after and now
he’ll be able to do this with dignity. We bought goods for him worth INR
25,500(swipe post for receipt). We have also ordered other supplies worth
INR 9500 from a nearby market and this will be handed to him in a day.</p>
