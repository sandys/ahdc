They also shared the challenges they face while working for the concerned community, which one might encounter as well, and mentored ways to tackle them The drive was delayed for a few hours due to transport vehicle being stuck in the traffic. Meanwhile, the team members were warmly offered lunch by the resource person. Since the food coupons were already distributed the day before, thus everything was set to run systematically. The plan of action was to collect their coupons and copies of their identity card on one counter and distribute ration kits on the other. Once the transport arrived, the members moved to an empty plot of land where the distribution was scheduled. A few plastic chairs and 2 wooden beds constituted the make-shiJ counters. The crowd of ration collectors constituted mostly of women. The reason being men mostly went out during day to find daily wage works. Despite it being uDerly humid day, the turnout was huge and the crowd was co- operative. The collectors included many people who were either too old or handicapped. The team members readily helped such people to carry their kits to their homes. The local community was ex- tremely helpful and time and again offered to fill water boDles for the members while they worked in the sun. It took about 45 minutes to an hour to distribute 50 ration kits, thanks to the systematic setup. AJer half of the kits were distributed, there was another interruption of about 45 minutes because of a similar problem with the transport, that was meant to carry the other half of the kits. During this break many members from the community came requesting for a spare kit, either because they haven’t been alloDed coupons in the current phase, or for an extended family that was in uDer need.

The first apparent problem was linguistic. Since the community consisted mostly of immigrants, they lacked fluency in the regional language. This made it difficult for them to work in the local sector, where they belonged. Along with this, rampant illiteracy made them ignorant to reach out to the au- thori/es for help, opening doors to bigger problems. For example, many members of the community owned an AADHAR card, thanks to the efforts of some local social work groups, however the cards had many technical errors from spellings to address. Understandably they never got it corrected, because they could neither read, nor understand the possible problems they might face in future due to it. The second problem was poor living conditions that contributed to diseases. Since the community is coopera/ve, larger drives like medical awareness and health-camps can be organised by community par/cipa/on. Rampant unemployment and dire shortage of skill-development and vocational training programmes in the area contribute to its economic backwardness."),n.a.createElement("span",{className:"image fit"},n.a.createElement("img",{src:f.a,alt:""})))))},o}(n.a.Component);t.default=b},"7IN3":function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/fooddrive2-016e657b95df2377f157338570d6bfff.jpg"},JHg4:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/fooddrive3-ae89655ca6fa5a0b4983d8f10c2bae43.jpg"},KzCQ:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/fooddrive4-c5280d419b34a6e7c1958a1554b06c39.png"},mkUf:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/fooddrive1-78a36846a9228dcfd822e6c2cd5bab6c.jpg"}}]);
