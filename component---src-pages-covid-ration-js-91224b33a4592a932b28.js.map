But the lockdown brought another very acute crisis upon the survivors\nType to enter a caption.\n\nwho had just started rebuilding their lives. They are now fighting with this medical lock-\ndown without food and basic essentials. There are also very many daily wagers and\n\nlabourers who are suddenly jobless and hence penny less. And they cannot fight hunger &\ndisease together. So AHDC is trying to reach out to as many daily wagers, labourers and\nsurvivors in North East Delhi to help them buy ration & essentials. Food & medicines is\npriority at this time and we are doing this in multiple ways with all legal permissions and\nextreme precautions. We extend help in few ways:\n<ul>\n    <li> Pay for peopleâ€™s ration at the local grocery & kirana shops via PayTM/ Phone Pe</li>\n    <li> Distribute ration to localities</li>\n    <li> Distribute ready-to-eat meals in localities & colonies</li>\n    <li> Respond to SOS calls of ration requirements in North East Delhi</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nAreas covered: Mustafabad(Old & New), Shiv Vihar, Khajoori Khas, Nehru Vihar, Chand-\nbagh, Noor-e-Ilahi, Bhajanpura, Moonga Nagar, Babu Nagar, Subhash Mohalla, Kar-\ndampuri.\n</p>\n<p>\nAHDC has served over 10,000 people in various areas of North East Delhi with food & ra-\ntion distribution.\n</p>\n\n \n    <span className=\"image fit\"><img src={covidrationdrive2} alt=\"\" /></span>\n    <span className=\"image fit\"><img src={covidrationdrive3} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n\n\n            <h2>REQUEST FOR DONATION</h2>\n            <p>We require your support in raising money for buying ration for distribution as well as to set\nup payments.
