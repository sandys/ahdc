The basic aim of the drive is to provide clothes to\nthose people who are in need and collect clothes from those\npeople who are willing to donate.</p>\n<ul className=\"actions\">\n <li> \n    <span className=\"image left\"><img src={IMG_2138} alt=\"\" /></span>\n    <span className=\"image left\"><img src={IMG_2125} alt=\"\" /></span>\n </li>\n</ul>\n\n            <h2>Venue /Community</h2>\n            <p>The Dhobhi Ghat community is near Jamia Millia Islamia metro\nstation at Batla House. The community consists of around 1500\npeople and they do menial jobs for their living. The men living\nare daily labourers and women are domestic workers. The\nliteracy rate of the community is very low and the present\nyouth of the community is also not going to the community.</p>\n\n<h2>Material</h2>\n            <p>Clothes for the people of all ages of the community.</p>\n\n            <h2>Activity</h2>\n            <p>The members of the community collected clothes from\ndifferent places and segregated clothes. Then members of the\nAHDC met on 17-01-2020 at the Jamia Millia Islamia with the\nclothes that they have collected from people. Then the\nmembers of AHDC went to community and met people of the\nHARF foundation. The drive was collaboration with Harf\nFoundation. Members of both the community collected their\nclothes at the school space that was being under construction\nthere. The members of the both the organisation started\nsegregating the clothes on the basic of genders. Then the\npeople of the community were informed about the clothe\ndistribution. The people gathered in front school for the clothes\ndistribution within 15 minutes to collect clothes. Then the\ndistribution of the clothes started, the gate keeper asked 5\npeople to enter and the members of both the organisation\nstarted giving clothes to people according to the age group and\ngender of the people. The members took section according to\nthe age groups or genders and people were sent accordingly to\ntheir clothes section and the people collected the clothes which\nfitted them. Like this the members of the community collected\nall the clothes according to their needs.</p>\n\n<h2>Analysis</h2>\n            <p>The members of the community were well satisfied with the\ndrive. Many of the people came and thanked the members of\n\norganisation. The motive of the organisation of resource\nmobilization was achieved. Many people did the packing very\nnicely by providing washing detergents in them, this showed\nthat they not donating just for the sake rather they really want\nto help people who are in need.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n            <p>The activity was systematically planned, organised, and most\nimportantly- in the right direction. Effort was put that the\nprocess could be as convenient and as swift as possible for the\nbeneficiaries. Plans are underway to conduct the phase 2 and 3\nof the campaign as soon as possible, in order to cover the\nentire population of the area.\nAlso, since literacy is a huge problem in this community, a\nfuture possibility would be to design campaigns that connect\nthe children to primary school and adults to basic adult\neducation program run by the Government of India and the\nDelhi Government like National Adult Education Plan (NAEP).</p>\n\n<h2>Drive in association with One Way Foundation in November\n2019</h2>\n            <p>Team AHDC &amp; One Way Trust got together to distribute clothes\nfor the underprivileged community at Shram Vihar. We\ndistributed clothes to approximately 200 people with donated\n\nas well as new clothes. Most beneficiaries were children &amp;\nwomen.</p>\n<ul className=\"actions\">\n <li> \n    <span className=\"image left\"><img src={I0d1ebf26} alt=\"\" /></span>\n    <span className=\"image left\"><img src={I7fb8030f} alt=\"\" /></span>\n    <span className=\"image left\"><img src={da44159d} alt=\"\" /></span>\n    <span className=\"image left\"><img src={f26715e7} alt=\"\" /></span>\n </li>\n</ul>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Generic\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/IMG_2125-37918be14a46b1cd2008d3e903384c86.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
