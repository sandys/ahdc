As soon as the violence subsided our teams got\n\non the ground to assess the damage and figure out relief initiatives. For 15\ndays AHDC distributed aid and relief material to the victims of the North East\nDelhi Pogrom 2020. We were able to reach out to more than 350 people and\ngive them clothes, blankets, ration and utilities. But very soon we realised that\nrelief and aid was a short term support. We realised it was important to help\nthe victims of the North East Delhi pogrom 2020 get back on their feet. They\n\nhad families to support and the survivors understood that they can’t be de-\npendent on relief material. It was also a big boost to their confidence when\n\nthey are able to restart their lives. They wanted to go back to a life of dignity\nand self sufficiency. So AHDC launched the Survivor Rehabilitation Initiative\n\nwith an aim to get people back on their feet. We went about this very system-\natically.:\n<ul>\n    <li> Started with 15 people we identified from the data we had collected during\nrelief distribution.</li>\n    <li> We met these 15 individuals and had detailed discussion with them in our\noffice in Mustafabad to assess what they needed to restart their work and\nhow much money would be allocated to each.</li>\n    <li> We laid out some ground rules of operation. We would not hand out any\ncash to survivors. Our volunteers would accompany the individual and\nbuy all they require. We would provide all receipts and pictues of goods\npurchased for each survivor.</li>\n    <li> Post planning for 15 people we started our donations drive activated on\nsocial media and word of mouth.</li>\n      <li>Once we had met the targeted amount we called each of the survivors &\nbought the goods required by them.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe conducted 3 successful waves of survivor rehabilitation in this manner\nwhen this work had to abruptly stop due to the COVID 19 health crisis. But\nwe remain committed to this cause. As soon as the lockdown lifts and we are\n\nallowed to resume “regular” work, AHDC will spring back in action to help re-\nhabilitate more survivors. Here are some successful cases of rehabilitation.\n</p>\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={aliahmed} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Ali Ahmed</h2>\n            <p>Ali Ahmed was a 60 year old resident of Shiv Vihar. He has a family of 10 and\nused to run a small bookshop selling religious books in Shiv Vihar itself near\nMedina Masjid. On 25th February things got very dangerous in the area and\nhe was forced to abandon his shop and flee to the Masjid when angry mobs\nsurrounded his shop. His shop was looted and his stock destroyed. There\nwas a lot of damage to the structure also. But we’ve been able to help Ali\nAhmed get back to his livelihood. He needed INR 15,000 to buy a fresh stock\nof books he can keep at his shop to re-open it. Our volunteer went with his son(in picture) and bought stock(books) for that much money and now Ali and\nhis sons are setting up the bookstore again.</p>\n \n    \n    <span className=\"image fit\"><img src={israr} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n    <h2>Israr Ahmed</h2>\n            <p>Israr Ahmed, 45, worked as a contractual carpenter and lived in Shiv Vihar\nphase 10. He was forced to flee his home with family when violence broke\nout in the area on the 25th of February. When he went back to take stock of\n\ndamage around 29th Feb he found his whole house was ransacked and loot-\ned. The mobs had destroyed everything including his whole kit of tools. Un-\nable to get back to work without it, Israr ji was very disturbed because he is\n\nthe sole breadwinner of his family. But now, Israr Ahmed is the owner of a\nbrand new set of tools which means he can get back to seeking work.</p>\n\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={riyaz} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Riyaz Ud Din</h2>\n        <p>Riyaz ud din, a resident of Shiv Vihar phase 7, used to sells eggs on a thela.\nHe not only lost his home when mobs attacked and looted their at large in\ntheir area, his thela was also snatched and set on fire by the perpetrators.\nRiyaz ud din ji has a large family to support and was completely broken in\nspirit when we met him. He was a daily wager with no savings and at the age of 67 he didn’t know what other work he could pick up. We were able to give\nRiyaz ud din ji a new thela & the first starter stock of eggs to sell. He went\nback to work the very day he got the goods!</p>\n\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={ibrahim} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Ibrahim</h2>\n        <p>Ibrahim is an enterprising young man who ran a small photostat & money\ntransfer shop in Shiv Vihar. He had flee his shop and take refuge at Medina\n\nMasjid with his family when the mobs attacked. His small shop was complete-\nly destroyed and he himself narrowly escaped when some rioters threw acid\n\nat him. He bears some burn wounds on his leg and feet when droplets landed\non him. He really did escape by the skin of his teeth. Unfortunately he\n\ncouldn’t save his shop. But this young man wasted no time in collecting him-\nself and started figuring how to get back to his work with some help. When he\n\ncame to us he had already figured help with his photostat machine but\ncouldn’t complete the amount for a laptop he needed. So we pitched in and\nhelped him buy a laptop. Ibrahim will start his work again.</p>\n\n\n\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={dilshad} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Dilshad Khan</h2>\n        <p>Dilshad Khan had been running an electrical supplies shop in Shiv Vihar\n\nphase 7 for 19 years. Never had he seen such a carnage. When things esca-\nlated in his neighbourhood, he fled his home & shop with his family leaving\n\neverything behind on 25th night. He was only allowed to visit back on 4th\nMarch. And everything he had had been looted. His shop and home both\nwere ransacked, his stuff thrown out and destroyed, stolen or burnt. Taking\nrefuge with a relative in Alvi Nagar, for the time being, this father of 3 was\n\ndesperate to restart his work. We were able to raise funds for him to buy elec-\ntrical goods to start his shop again.</p>\n\n\n<span className=\"image fit\"><img src={sayed} alt=\"\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Sayed Ahmed</h2>\n        <p>We were able to raise INR 35,000 for Sayed Ahmed ji’s sewing machine re-\npair shop. He is a resident of Shiv Vihar and during the recent violence that\n\nbroke out he lost his shop, tools and all supplies. Mobs threw out his goods\nand set fire to everything. But now with the help of new equipment he will be\nable to start again. He has a 14 year old son and wife to look after and now\nhe’ll be able to do this with dignity. We bought goods for him worth INR\n25,500(swipe post for receipt). We have also ordered other supplies worth\nINR 9500 from a nearby market and this will be handed to him in a day.</p>\n\n\n\n\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Generic\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/riyaz-47122693bf004748f313ed93f3e3ccf0.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
